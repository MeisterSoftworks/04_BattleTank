# BattleTank
CONCEPT
A confection-themed open world tank game, where you pilot a sugary sweet vehicle of destruction and battle against CPU-controlled tanks. The terrain will have some hills but will largely be flat and peppered with tasty obstacles. Timing your shots in this game is crucial for victory in this game, as your opponents will likely not give you much time to consider your choices before blowing you sky-high.
The game will utilize bright and cheery visuals to paint a magical color-filled environment, contrasted by a backdrop of hard-hitting SFX and screaming heavy metal music. Only one tank can reign supreme in the end, so a race to the last armor standing has begun!

RULES
⦁	Win Condition: To eliminate all the other tanks on the the battlefield. When a cpu tank is destroyed it will not respawn.
⦁	Lose Condition: If your tank sustains too much damage it will explode the game will be over.

⦁	Actions
⦁	Movement will be based on independently using left and right treads. Move speed will be slow and turning sharply isn't possible without coming to almost a full stop.
⦁	Your weapon of choice is a mighty cannon mounted on a rotating turret, which will fire a strong projectile over a long distance.
⦁	Collect metal scrap on the ground to refill health.

⦁	Illegal Actions
⦁	Scaling inclines will be limited to shallow and moderate slopes at best. Steep hills will not be climbable (Will need to set parameter in code to prevent that).
⦁	Firing quickly is not possible and will be limited to slow-firing, precise volleys with a reload period.
⦁	Structures cannot be destroyed but can be used for cover.


REQUIREMENTS
⦁	Art Direction: Atmosphere should evoke feelings of a candy paradise or sweet pastries. Tanks will be made to look like unique confections of warfare. Environment should be sticky sweet and mouth-watering to practically induce cavities.
⦁	3D Models
⦁	Cupcake Tank Turret
⦁	Graham Cracker Armoring
⦁	Licorice Tracks w/ Cookie Wheels
⦁	Gumdrop Shells

⦁	Particles
⦁	Sparkles

⦁	Music: Should be powerful and commanding, preference to a distorted or crushed-down tonality with soaring bright synth leads. Synth wave is optional, echoing the sounds of Lazerhawk and Dance with the Dead.
 
⦁	Sound Effects: Should be powerful in nature with a bit of whimsy shine. Movement will have layered sounds for the terrain you ride on and the tracks the tank currently is using.
⦁	Reloading
